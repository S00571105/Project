### Executive Summary

This project will encompass research on remote information technology teaching opportunities in colleges and vocational training organiations. The project will include scope of research, resources, discussion of research and a conclusion that will incorporate future considerations and/or challenges.

### Part Part 1: Project Intent and Plan

I will do Option 2. A brief description of my research project is research remote information technology teaching opportunities in colleges and vocational training organizations.

### Project Part 2:
Information Technology Teaching Opportunities

Executive Summary/Topic Summary
This paper will discuss Information Technology Teaching opportunities. The paper will include an introduction, scope of research, identified resources, discussion of research, consider future considerations and challenges and a conclusion.
Introduction
In 1985 when Steve Jobs predicted that computers and technology would change the world in many ways. No one could have imagined how the educational and business landscape would change to accommodate the increasing needs for Information Technology skills in every job. With the focus of ensuring all students have information technology skills to succeed in today’s computer driven world the information technology teaching opportunities have increased. 
Scope of Research
In conducting research by reviewing articles on the topic of Information Technology Teaching opportunities it was noted the literature breaks out Information Technology Teaching opportunities by student’s academic grade level.
Identify /Cite Resources
The articles reviewed were :Computer Teacher: Education Requirements Salary and Other Career information by Eric Gill, The CS Teacher Shortage by Esther Shein and US Bureau of Labor Statistics Computer Science Teachers-Post Secondary.


Information Technology Teaching Opportunities

Discussion of Research
The three articles reviewed will be discussed in detail below.
Computer Teacher: Education Requirements Salary and Other Career information by Eric Gill
In this article Eric Gill discusses how computer technology teaching includes a lot of subjects. The vast subject matter may include computer hardware through software programming. And the computer technology teaching courses may include mathematics. He also points out that k-8 computer technology teachers usually have bachelor’s degree, high school computer teachers usually have a bachelor’s or master’s degree and college/postsecondary computer technology teachers usually have a masters or doctorate degree. In addition he shared the job outlook growth in k-8 and high school computer technology teachers was greater than six percent  and the job outlook growth for college/postsecondary was greater than nine percent. Furthermore he shares factors that may help one decide which grade level to teach at. The factors he discusses are: teacher’s academic level, knowledge base, salary considerations, job opportunities and teacher preference to teach at a certain grade level. And then he discusses the importance of teachers to keep their skills up-to-date by professional development and joining associations. This article definitely noted there were a lot of computer technology teaching opportunities.
The CS Teacher Shortage by Esther Shein
Esther Shein discusses the Computer Science Teacher shortage. Basically in this article it points out that colleges are not producing large quantities of computer science majors and graduated computer science majors are opting to go into industry versus academia due to the fact the pay is considerable less in academia versus industry. The author even notes there is a shortage of 
Information Technology Teaching Opportunities

computer science teachers at the k-12 level. In addition this article discusses ways to remedy the shortage. The remedies discussed to decrease the shortage are: to decrease the teacher quality standards, reduce enrollments or have larger classes. Unfortunately these remedies will not meet industry or academia computer science needs. The article further suggested that colleges should start to expose undergraduate computer science students to teaching opportunities during their undergraduate classwork to increase student’s interest in the teaching field and show the student the value of teaching. With this early exposure to teaching, hopefully more students would pursue information technology teach opportunities. However to date there still remains a shortage of information technology teachers.
US Bureau of Labor Statistics-Computer Science Teachers-Postsecondary
The last article/report reviewed was the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Computer Science Teachers-Postsecondary. This article/report showed that there was continued growth in Computer Science Teachers-Postsecondary field of colleges, universities, professional schools and junior colleges and more. In addition the annual wage range was from 82k to 169K.  The article/report basically reiterated that there are information technologies teaching opportunities and the opportunities are strong in the postsecondary level.
Future Considerations /Challenges
Basically all three articles noted there were information technology teaching opportunities. In looking at future considerations in the information technology field it is important that the future information technology teacher’s  carefully review the opportunities to ensure the information

technology future teacher’s education, skill set, grade level teaching preference and goals match up with the academic organization opportunity. In addition the information technology future teacher challenges may include teaching information technology courses to a large student size due to the fact  information technology courses are in high demand.
Conclusion
This paper discussed Information Technology Teaching opportunities. The paper also included an introduction, scope of research, identified resources, discussion of research, considered future considerations and challenges in Information Technology Teaching opportunities.


### Conclusion

Attached is the final part of the Project Part 2 option a brief description of my research project named remote information technology teaching opportunities.
